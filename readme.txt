== Description ==

Restrict the related products on a woo commerce single product page to a specific category.Restrict
Also if there are more than 4 related products then they need to be displayed in a carousel otherwise just left alone.

== Installation ==

Currently this plugin is hardcoded to use a category from the solus project -  and also the numner of products to displayed
is hard coded.
So if you want to change this then it needs to be done in code. Also if you just want to display related products in 
a carousel without a restriction it cant be done at the moment.

Currently this plugin is hardcoded to use a category and also the numner of products.
Needs an admin page to change the category , or set to null, and include in carousel option checkbox with numner of related
products. Just not had time.
